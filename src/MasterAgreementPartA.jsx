    <div className="w-full border-t-4 border-black my-6" />
    <h3 style={headingStyle}>2.2 CLOUD STORAGE ARCHITECTURE & TEMPORARY BUFFERING</h3>
    <p style={textStyle}>The User acknowledges and agrees that SpectroModel utilizes a specialized "Cloud-First" architecture designed to maximize privacy and minimize liability. <strong style={headingStyle}>Raw audio files uploaded by the User are NOT permanently stored on SpectroModel servers.</strong> The Company employs a volatile memory processing protocol wherein audio files are loaded into Random Access Memory (RAM) solely for the duration of the analysis (typically 30 to 60 seconds). Immediately upon the completion of the requested analysis (e.g., Track Analysis, Rhythm Calculation, or Stem Separation), the audio buffer is irreversibly cleared from the server’s memory. No copy of the raw audio waveform is retained by the Company. Only the resultant analytical data (metadata, JSON results, spectrogram images, and hit scores) is saved to the User’s designated cloud storage account. The Company is not liable for the loss of any raw audio files, as it does not act as a file storage repository.</p>

    <div className="w-full border-t-4 border-black my-6" />
    <h3 style={headingStyle}>2.3 "AI LEARNS FROM MY DATA" MANDATE</h3>

The User understands that all interactions, uploaded metadata, analysis results, and usage patterns may be utilized by the Company to train, refine, recalibrate, and improve the Company’s proprietary Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. This data usage is strictly for service improvement, algorithmic weighting adjustments (e.g., refining Hip Hop 80s/90s detection logic), and bias reduction. This mandate does not grant the Company the right to sell personal User data to third-party advertisers, but rather to use anonymized data points for internal technological advancement.</p>

    <h2 style={headingStyle}>SECTION III: INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY & PROPRIETARY RIGHTS</h2>

    <div className="w-full border-t-4 border-black my-6" />
    <h3 style={headingStyle}>3.1 EXCLUSIVE COMPANY OWNERSHIP</h3>
    <p style={textStyle}><strong style={headingStyle}>COMPANY OWNS ALL COMPANY'S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.</strong> SpectroModel ENT., the Creator(s), and the Owner(s) retain exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, and inalienable ownership of the App, its source code, binary executables, object code, and all proprietary algorithms contained therein. This ownership extends to, but is not limited to the Hip Hop 80s/90s/2000s detection logic, Pop Hit Score calculators, Digital Signal Processing (DSP) engines, "VibeVision™" visualization technology, and all AI training datasets.</p>

    <div className="w-full border-t-4 border-black my-6" />
    <h3 style={headingStyle}>3.2 NO THEFT, REPLICATION, OR REVERSE ENGINEERING</h3>
    <p style={textStyle}>No User, person, entity, competitor, or automated agent is permitted to use, steal, replicate, clone, distribute, or reverse engineer the name "SpectroModel," the "SpectroModel" logo, the "VibeVision" trademark, or any associated brand assets without the Owner(s)'s and Creator(s)'s expressed, written, and notarized consent. Any attempt to decompile the App, analyze its network traffic for the purpose of cloning, or extract the underlying Hit Prediction algorithms constitutes a material breach of this Agreement. The Company reserves the right to pursue all available legal remedies, including injunctive relief and statutory damages, against violators.</p>

    <div className="w-full border-t-4 border-black my-6" />
    <h3 style={headingStyle}>3.3 AUTOMATED ENFORCEMENT PROTOCOLS</h3>
    <p style={textStyle}>This provision implies continuous monitoring and automated enforcement protocols active on the User's account. The App contains security measures designed to detect unauthorized tampering, debugging, or code injection. Triggering these protocols may result in an immediate, non-appealable ban of the User's account, IP address, and hardware ID. The Creator(s)’s authority in defining and enforcing these rights is absolute and non-negotiable.</p>

    <div className="w-full border-t-4 border-black my-6" />
    <h3 style={headingStyle}>3.4 TRADEMARK & PATENT NOTIFICATIONS</h3>
    <p style={textStyle}>The User acknowledges that "SpectroModel™", "VibeVision™", and "SpectroVerse™" are legally registered trademarks of SpectroModel ENT. Furthermore, the underlying technological frameworks, specifically the <strong style={headingStyle}>"No-Interference" security protocol</strong>, the <strong style={headingStyle}>"Auto-Healing" monitors</strong>, and the <strong style={headingStyle}>"Zero-Iteration" mastering engines</strong>, are protected by pending and granted international patents.

    <h2 style={headingStyle}>SECTION IV: FEATURE-SPECIFIC TERMS OF USE & ALGORITHMIC DISCLAIMERS</h2>

    <div className="w-full border-t-4 border-black my-6" />
    <h3 style={headingStyle}>4.1 TRACK ANALYSIS & HIT PREDICTION SCORING</h3>
    <p style={textStyle}>The App provides a "Track Analysis" feature that generates a "Hit Prediction" score on a scale of 0 to 10. The User understands and agrees that these scores are the result of mathematical calculations based on audio features such as tempo, energy, and danceability, compared against a historical database of 175 million streaming data points and chart data (e.g., Billboard Hot 100, Spotify Viral 50). A low analysis score does <strong style={headingStyle}>NOT</strong> imply that a musical composition is of poor artistic quality, lacks merit, or is "bad". Rather, it indicates that the algorithmic calculations deem the song's acoustic characteristics do not currently align with the specific statistical patterns of mainstream "Pop" hits or high-velocity viral trends found in the training dataset.</p>

    <div className="w-full border-t-4 border-black my-6" />
    <h3 style={headingStyle}>4.2 GENRE-SPECIFIC ALGORITHMIC NUANCE & NON-PREJUDICE</h3>
    <p style={textStyle}>The Company explicitly disclaims any bias or prejudice in its algorithmic scoring. The User acknowledges that specific genres, particularly Hip Hop music from the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s, may utilize production techniques that differ from modern Pop standards. Consequently, a track may score lower on a "Pop" probability scale while remaining a culturally significant or "great" song within urban communities or specific demographic niches. The analysis results mean nothing beyond what the raw data calculations display. The Company asserts that no discrimination, racism, or prejudice is intended by the coding structure, and the Creator(s) reserves the right to remove, amend, or recalibrate these algorithms at the Owner(s)'s discrepancy to improve accuracy.</p>

    <div className="w-full border-t-4 border-black my-6" />
    <h3 style={headingStyle}>4.3 DEFAMATION & LIBEL WAIVER</h3>
    <p style={textStyle}>The User agrees that analytical outputs, including but not limited to Hit Scores, Market Fit assessments, and Rhythm Analysis graphs, do not constitute defamation, libel, or slander against the User or the artist. These outputs are automated, objective data visualizations and are not subjective critical reviews. The User waives any right to pursue civil litigation against the Company, Creator(s), or Employee(s) based on the perceived reputational damage caused by a low algorithmic score or an unfavorable market analysis.</p>

    <div className="w-full border-t-4 border-black my-6" />
    <h3 style={headingStyle}>4.4 RHYTHM ANALYSIS & DSP INTERPRETATION</h3>
    <p style={textStyle}>The "Rhythm Analysis" tool utilizes Digital Signal Processing (DSP) to detect groove patterns, timing offsets, and rhythmic consistency. This feature is provided for educational, creative, and informative purposes only. The User acknowledges that "Groove" is subjective and that the App's detection of "timing errors" may be intentional artistic choices (e.g., "swing" or "human feel"). The Company is not responsible for any production decisions made by the User based on the App’s visual feedback.</p>

    <div className="w-full border-t-4 border-black my-6" />

The User agrees that all information provided must be accurate and truthful. Impersonating another artist, fabricating accolades, or using a stage name that infringes on an existing trademark is a violation of this Agreement. The Company reserves the right to suspend profiles that utilize deceptive metadata to game the "Market Fit" or "Discovery" algorithms.</p>

    <p style={textStyle}>The "Market Fit Analysis" requires the User to "Upload Track" and provide specific details including "Song Length" (e.g., "3:45") and "Notable Features" (e.g., "Features Drake"). The User acknowledges that the AI's assessment of commercial viability relies heavily on this metadata. Falsely listing a major artist feature (e.g., claiming a collaboration with Drake when none exists) to artificially inflate the "Hit Prediction" score is prohibited. Such manipulation corrupts the training data and may result in the track being flagged by the "No-Interference" security protocol.</p>

    <p style={textStyle}>The "Lyrics Analyzer" allows the User to "Paste your song lyrics here," providing examples such as "Walking down the street / Feeling so free". The User acknowledges that the "Analyze Lyrics" function submits this text to the Company's servers for processing. The User warrants that they have the right to analyze the text and that it does not contain hate speech or illegal content. The Company utilizes "Network errors handled gracefully" logic to ensure that text uploads do not result in data loss during transmission.</p>
    <div className="w-full border-t-4 border-black my-6" />

    <p style={textStyle}>Users may associate "Track Name" (e.g., "Bohemian Rhapsody") and "Artist Name" (e.g., "Queen") with their lyric analysis. The User understands that this association helps the AI contextualize the lyrics within specific genres or eras. However, utilizing the names of famous tracks to analyze unrelated text is considered data pollution and is discouraged to maintain the integrity of the "AI Learns From My Data" ecosystem.</p>

    <p style={textStyle}>The "Monetization Hub" includes a "Revenue Trend (Last 6 Months)" visualization tool. The User acknowledges that this graph is generated based on self-reported data or data imported via third-party APIs. The Company does not audit the accuracy of the revenue figures input by the User. A trend showing "+28% Monthly Growth" is a retrospective calculation and does not imply that future months will sustain similar growth rates. The Company is not liable for business decisions (e.g., hiring staff, purchasing equipment) made by the User based on these trend projections.</p>
    <div className="w-full border-t-4 border-black my-6" />
    <h3 style={headingStyle}>60.2 ROYALTY CALCULATOR & PLATFORM RATES</h3>

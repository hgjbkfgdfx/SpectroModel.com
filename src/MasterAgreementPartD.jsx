    <div className="w-full border-t-4 border-black my-6" /><h3>174.1 METADATA REFINEMENT PROTOCOLS</h3>
    <p>The "AI Track Query" tool utilizes a machine learning algorithm that "learns from every search" to refine its metadata association logic. The User acknowledges that when they enter specific search criteria, such as "Track Name" or "Artist Name" (e.g., "Fire is King - j spectro"), the App records this query syntax to improve future fuzzy matching capabilities. The User agrees that this data harvesting is essential for the "Lyrics Retrieval" engine to function effectively across diverse spelling variations and regional character sets. The Company utilizes this aggregated query data to build a proprietary index of "Recent Searches" that optimizes retrieval speed for the entire user base.</p>
    <div className="w-full border-t-4 border-black my-6" /><h3>174.2 SEARCH RESULT LIABILITY</h3>
    <p>The User acknowledges that the "Search" function queries external databases to populate results. The Company does not verify the copyright status or accuracy of the "song information and lyrics sources" returned by these queries. The User agrees that utilizing retrieved metadata for commercial releases (e.g., uploading to Spotify via the "Distribution" command center) is done at their own risk. The Company is not liable for metadata rejection by DSPs caused by incorrect information retrieved through the AI Track Query tool.</p>
    
    <div className="section-break" />
    
    <h2>SECTION CLXXV: COPYRIGHT REGISTRATION TECHNICALITIES</h2>
    <div className="w-full border-t-4 border-black my-6" /><h3>175.1 LARGE FILE COMPRESSION & INTEGRITY</h3>
    <p>The "Copyright Protection" tool features specific logic for handling high-fidelity assets. The User acknowledges that "<strong>Large audio files (&gt;30MB) are automatically compressed for faster upload</strong>". The User agrees that this compression is a necessary compromise to facilitate the generation of the timestamped certificate. The Company asserts that the cryptographic hash is generated based on the uploaded stream, ensuring the "timestamped proof of creation" remains valid even if the file is compressed for storage efficiency.</p>
    <div className="w-full border-t-4 border-black my-6" /><h3>175.2 SUPPORTED REGISTRATION FORMATS</h3>
    <p>The User acknowledges that the Copyright Protection tool accepts a broad range of creative assets, specifically "<strong>Audio, Images, Videos, PDFs, Documents</strong>" with a maximum file size of "<strong>200MB</strong>". The User agrees that uploading a "PDF" or "Document" (e.g., a lyric sheet or split sheet) creates a timestamp for that specific file version only. The Company is not responsible for version control disputes if the User fails to register subsequent edits or drafts of the work.</p>
    
    <div className="section-break" />
    
    <h2>SECTION CLXXVI: REMOTE TOUCH & WEARABLE INTEGRATION</h2>

    <h2>SECTION CLXXVIII: CLOUD SETTINGS & SOVEREIGNTY</h2>
    <div className="w-full border-t-4 border-black my-6" /><h3>178.1 PROVIDER-SPECIFIC INTEGRATION BENEFITS</h3>
    <p>The User acknowledges the specific benefits of connecting different cloud providers. For instance, connecting "<strong>Google Cloud</strong>" or "<strong>Microsoft/Azure</strong>" facilitates the "<strong>Automatic sync across platforms</strong>" feature. The User agrees that "<strong>Work seamlessly across devices</strong>" is a functionality contingent upon the User maintaining an active subscription with their chosen cloud storage vendor. The Company is not responsible for sync errors caused by a User's cloud account being locked for non-payment.</p>
    <div className="w-full border-t-4 border-black my-6" /><h3>178.2 RIGHT TO DISCONNECT & DATA REMOVAL</h3>
    <p>The User retains the absolute right to "<strong>Disconnect anytime</strong>" via the Settings menu. The User acknowledges that invoking this command severs the link between SpectroModel and the third-party cloud. The User agrees that after disconnection, the App can no longer save "<strong>analysis results</strong>" or "<strong>settings</strong>" to the cloud, effectively reverting the App to a read-only or local-only state until a new connection is established.</p>
    
    <div className="section-break" />
    
    <h2>SECTION CLXXIX: ADVANCED TONAL SHAPING PARAMETERS</h2>
    <div className="w-full border-t-4 border-black my-6" /><h3>179.1 PSYCHOACOUSTIC TONE CONTROLS</h3>
    <p>The "Advanced Mixing" module provides specific controls for "Tone," including sliders for "<strong>Warmth,</strong>" "<strong>Brightness,</strong>" "<strong>Sharpness,</strong>" and "<strong>Smoothness</strong>". The User acknowledges that these parameters default to an intensity of "<strong>30%</strong>". The User agrees that "Warmth" adds harmonic saturation to low-mid frequencies, while "Brightness" boosts high-shelf frequencies. The Company disclaims liability for "harshness" or "mud" introduced into the mix if the User increases these values beyond the recommended 30% threshold without adequate monitoring equipment.</p>
    <div className="w-full border-t-4 border-black my-6" /><h3>179.2 CLARITY ENHANCEMENT ALGORITHMS</h3>
    <p>The User acknowledges the "<strong>Clarity</strong>" parameter, which defaults to a boost of "<strong>2.0dB</strong>". This algorithm utilizes transient shaping to emphasize the attack of percussive elements. The User agrees that excessive use of the Clarity tool may result in "thin" audio or increased sibilance, particularly on vocal tracks that have not been processed by the "Sibilance Corrector" first.</p>
    
    <div className="section-break" />
    
    <h2>SECTION CLXXX: SHEET MUSIC LIBRARY SPECIFICS</h2>
    <div className="w-full border-t-4 border-black my-6" /><h3>180.1 TRACK-SPECIFIC KEY DETECTION EXAMPLES</h3>
    <p>The "Sheet Music Library" displays specific analysis examples to illustrate the AI's capabilities. The User acknowledges the detection of "<strong>Key: C major</strong>" for tracks like "<strong>kanye-west-bittersweet-poetry</strong>" and "<strong>TARGET MAT (ROUGH)</strong>". Conversely, complex tracks like "<strong>Kendrick Lamar - HUMBLE.</strong>" are detected in "<strong>Key: C#</strong>". The User agrees that these keys are algorithmic estimates. The "View" button renders the notation based on this estimated key. The Company is not liable if the AI misinterprets a relative minor key as its major counterpart (e.g., A Minor vs. C Major).</p>
    <div className="w-full border-t-4 border-black my-6" /><h3>180.2 TRANSPOSITION & RE-KEYING</h3>
    <p>The User acknowledges the "<strong>New Key</strong>" feature available for analyzed tracks. This function allows the User to digitally transpose the generated sheet music. The User agrees that this transposition applies only to the visual notation and does not pitch-shift the underlying audio file unless the "Pitch Shift" tool in "Advanced Mixing" is simultaneously utilized.</p>
    
    <div className="section-break" />
    
    <h2>SECTION CLXXXI: LYRIC SEARCH HISTORY & CACHING</h2>
    <div className="w-full border-t-4 border-black my-6" /><h3>181.1 RECENT SEARCH LOGGING</h3>

    <p>The "Account Management" section explicitly lists the email "<strong>jspectro2016@gmail.com</strong>" associated with the "<strong>Account Type: Admin</strong>". The User acknowledges that accounts designated as "Admin" possess elevated privileges, including the ability to view the "Live Security Monitor" and "Change Audit Log". The User agrees that Admin credentials must be guarded with the highest level of security (e.g., 2FA, hardware keys). The Company is not liable for system-wide damages if an Admin account is compromised due to weak passwords or phishing.</p>
    <div className="w-full border-t-4 border-black my-6" /><h3>182.2 NON-TRANSFERABILITY OF ADMIN RIGHTS</h3>
    <p>The User agrees that "Admin" status is non-transferable. The "Creator(s)" maintains the ultimate authority to grant or revoke Admin privileges. Any attempt to sell, lease, or sub-license an Admin account to a third party is a material breach of this Agreement and will result in the immediate "Delete Account Permanently" protocol being invoked by the system.</p>
    
    <div className="section-break" />
    
    <h2>SECTION CLXXXIII: PATENTED SECURITY TECHNOLOGIES</h2>
    <div className="w-full border-t-4 border-black my-6" /><h3>183.1 NO-INTERFERENCE PROTOCOL</h3>
    <p>The Company asserts ownership of the "<strong>No-Interference</strong>" security protocol, a patented technology designed to prevent "quiet/loud hacker systems" from interrupting the "Zero-Iteration" data stream. The User acknowledges that this protocol operates at the network layer, actively filtering packet headers for malicious signatures. The User agrees that any attempt to tunnel through or bypass this protocol is a violation of the Company's patent rights.</p>
    <div className="w-full border-t-4 border-black my-6" /><h3>183.2 AUTO-HEALING MONITORS</h3>
    <p>The App utilizes "<strong>Auto-Healing</strong>" monitors, which are protected by "pending and granted patents". The User acknowledges that this technology automatically restarts crashed microservices (e.g., the "Market Fit" engine) without User intervention.

    <p>The User acknowledges the specific technical architecture regarding temporary file storage. The Company warrants that "<strong>After processing (30-60 seconds), the audio buffer is cleared from memory</strong>". The User agrees that this protocol ensures that raw audio files are "<strong>NOT permanently stored ANYWHERE</strong>" on the Company's infrastructure. Once the analysis results (JSON) are generated and pushed to the User's cloud account, the source file is irretrievably purged from the server's RAM.</p>
    <div className="w-full border-t-4 border-black my-6" /><h3>198.2 NO LIABILITY FOR UPLOAD INTERRUPTION</h3>
    <p>Due to this aggressive buffer clearance policy, the User acknowledges that if a network interruption occurs during the 30-60 second processing window, the analysis will fail, and the file must be re-uploaded.
